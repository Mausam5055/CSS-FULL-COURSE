/* In CSS, :hover and :active are pseudo-classes that define 
styles when an element is in a specific interactive state. 
Here's a detailed explanation:

              1.:hover
The :hover pseudo-class applies styles to an element when a 
user hovers over it with a pointing device (like a mouse). 
It is commonly used for interactive elements such as links, 
buttons, or divs */


             /* 2.:active
The :active pseudo-class applies styles to an element while it 
is being clicked or pressed. Once the click is released, 
the styles are removed */

div { 
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: aqua;
    border: 2px solid black;
}

/* adding pseudo class on the div for transition affect(
hover-affect) on the box */

/* Hover effect */
div:hover{ 
    background-color: bisque;
    color: red;
}

/* Active (click) effect */
div:active {
    background-color: greenyellow;
}

Combining :hover and :active
You can define both :hover and :active to create smooth and 
interactive user experiences.
