        <!-- ---------Transition Shorthand--------
The shorthand property transition lets you define all individual transition properties (property name, duration, timing-function, and delay) in a single line.

    ------------WITHOUT SHORTHAND------------

transition-property: font-size; /* Specifies the property to animate */
transition-duration: 2s; /* Specifies that the transition takes 2 seconds */
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out; /* Specifies that the animation will start slow, speed up, and then slow down */
transition-delay: 0.2s; /* Specifies that the transition will start after a delay of 0.2 seconds */
   

   --------------WITH SHORTHAND---------------
   the above can be written in single line of code as: 
transition: font-size 2s ease-in-out 0.2s; -->
