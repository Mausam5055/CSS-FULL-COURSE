  /* --------RELATIVE UNITS---------

In CSS, relative units are measurements that adjust based on 
the size of other elements or the environment, such as the 
parent element, the browser window, or the root element. 
They make your website more flexible and responsive.

Here are some common relative units:

        
/* 1. em

        A.Relative to the font size of the parent element.
        B.If the parent font size is 16px:
        1em = 16px
        2em = 32px

        Example:
        p {
          font-size: 2em; /* Twice the parent font size */
        
/* 
2. rem

        A.Relative to the font size of the root element (<html>), usually set to 16px by default.
        B.1rem = 16px (if the root font size is not changed).

        Example:
        p {
          font-size: 1.5rem; /* 1.5 times the root font size (16px * 1.5 = 24px) */

/* 3. %
        A.Percentage values are relative to the size of the 
        parent element.

        B.For widths:
        50% means half the parent's width.

        Example:
        div {
          width: 50%; /* Half the width of the parent container */
    

/*          
4. vw (Viewport Width)
        A.Relative to 1% of the viewport’s width 
        (browser window width).
        B.100vw is the full width of the browser window.

        Example:
        div {
          width: 50vw; /* 50% of the viewport width */
      
/* 
5. vh (Viewport Height)

        A.Relative to 1% of the viewport’s height (browser window height).
        B.100vh is the full height of the browser window.

        Example:
        div {
          height: 100vh; /* Full height of the viewport */
