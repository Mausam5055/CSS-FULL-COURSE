/* position: sticky in CSS makes an element act normal at first 
(like it's in its usual spot), but when you scroll to a certain point,
 it sticks to the screen, like a sticky note.

Easy way to understand:
1.Imagine a box on a page.
2.Normally, it stays in its place as you scroll.
3.With position: sticky, you can make it "stick" to the top 
(or side) of the page when you scroll far enough.

Example:
You tell the box: "Stay in your place, but if I scroll past you, 
stick to the top of the screen."

Hereâ€™s the rule you use in CSS:

        position: sticky;
        top: 0; /* Stick to the top of the screen */
/* 
It works like glue but only within its container. Once the container is 
out of view, the box scrolls away too. */ 



div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: aqua;
    border: 2px solid red;
    display: inline-block;
 }

 #box1 {
    position: static;
    /* fixed position of box that cannot be changed */
 }


#box2 {
    position:relative;
    top:10px; 
    /* moves by 10px from top from its current position */
    left:10px;
    /* moves by 10px towards left from its current position */
} 

#box3 {
    position:sticky;
    top:0px;
    /* box moves relative to the body tag in html(i.e its ancestor tag) */
}

#box4 {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    /* box moves relative to our entire wepage(document) */
}

/* scrol down in the html document in the webpage to see the differnence */
