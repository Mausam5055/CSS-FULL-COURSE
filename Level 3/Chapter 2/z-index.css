  /* ------Z INDEX-------

The z-index in CSS is like the layer number of an element. 
It controls which element appears on top when they overlap.

How it works:

1.Imagine youâ€™re stacking papers on a desk.
2.The higher the z-index number(+ve value), the higher the 
paper is in the stack.z-index : 1 / 2 / ...
3.Elements with a lower z-index(-ve valus) will be behind 
elements with a higher z-index. z-index : -1 / -2 / ..

Rules:
1.By default, elements have a z-index of 0.
2.If two elements have the same z-index, the one written 
later in the HTML will be on top.
3.z-index only works on elements with a position of relative, 
absolute, fixed, or sticky. */

    position:absolute;
    top:500px;

    z-index: 0;
    /* box moves relative to the body tag in html(i.e its ancestor tag) */
}

#box4 {
    position: fixed;
    top: 50px;
    /* box moves relative to our entire wepage(document) */
