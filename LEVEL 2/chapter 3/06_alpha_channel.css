     /* -----ALPHA CHANNEL--------

In CSS, an alpha channel controls the transparency 
(or opacity) of a color. It allows you to make colors 
partially or fully transparent.

How it works:
1.The alpha channel is a value between 0 and 1:
2.0 means the color is completely transparent (invisible).
3.1 means the color is completely opaque (fully visible).
4.Values like 0.5 make the color 50% transparent 
(semi-transparent).

Example:
You can define colors with transparency using rgba() or
hsla() functions:

RGBA: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

    eg.
    background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); 
    /* Red with 50% transparency */

/* HSLA: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

eg.
    background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.7); 
    /* Red with 70% visibility */

/* Why use it?

To make elements see-through, blending them with what's 
behind.For effects like overlays, highlights, or soft 
shadows.Think of it like tinted glass: the alpha channel 
is how much you "tint" the color's visibility. */
