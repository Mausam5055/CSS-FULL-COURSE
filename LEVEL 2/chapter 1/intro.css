 /* -----------BOX MODEL IN CSS--------------- */

/* The box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are 
rendered on a web page. It consists of the following components:

1.Content
The innermost part of the box, where text, images, or other content is 
displayed.

2.Padding
The space between the content and the border.
Padding creates space inside the box but outside the content.
The background color of the element is applied to the padding as well.

3.Border
A wrapping around the padding (or content if there's no padding).
You can set the width, style, and color of the border.

4.Margin
The space between the element and its neighboring elements.
Margins are transparent and don't inherit background colors. */
