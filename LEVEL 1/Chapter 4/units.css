/* In CSS, units are used to define the size of elements, like 
width, height, padding, margins, and font sizes. There are two 
main types of units:

1. Absolute Units
These are fixed and do not change based on the screen size or 
resolution.

    Examples:
    px (pixels): A fixed size. Example: width: 100px; makes 
    something 100 pixels wide.
    cm (centimeters) & mm (millimeters): Rarely used in web 
    design.in (inches): Also rare; 1 inch = 96px.
    Use case: When you need an element to stay the same size 
    no matter where itâ€™s displayed. */



/* ----------LINE HEIGHT IN CSS----------
In CSS, line-height controls the amount of space between lines 
of text in an element. It affects the vertical spacing, making 
text easier to read or fitting it within a specific layout */


/* 
Common Values:

        1.Numbers (Unitless):
Example: line-height: 1.5;
This means the line height is 1.5 times the size of the text.
It scales automatically with font size.

        2.Lengths (with units):
Example: line-height: 20px;
The space between lines is fixed, regardless of font size.

        3.Percentages:
Example: line-height: 150%;
This sets the line height to 150% of the font size.

        4.Normal:
Default value, based on the browser's default spacing 
(usually around 1.2). */
