  /* ----------CLASS SELECTOR-------- */

/* A class selector in CSS is used to style one or more elements 
that share the same class attribute. Unlike id, a class can be 
reused on multiple elements, making it more flexible.

How it works:
Use a . (dot) followed by the class name to target the 
element(s). */
