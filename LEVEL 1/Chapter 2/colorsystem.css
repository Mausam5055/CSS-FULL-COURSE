 /* The hexadecimal number system, also known as base-16, is a
 numeral system that uses 16 symbols to represent values. 
 These symbols include:

 Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
 Letters: A, B, C, D, E, F (representing values 10 through 15)  */

 /* In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), hexadecimal numbers are primarily used to specify colors. A hexadecimal color code starts with a # symbol, followed by 3 or 6 hexadecimal characters. These represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) components of a color.

 Syntax
 A hex color code looks like this:
 #RRGGBB or #RGB
 
 RR, GG, and BB: Represent the intensity of the red, green, and blue components, respectively.
 
 Each component ranges from 00 (minimum intensity) to FF (maximum intensity).
 Example: #FF0000 is pure red, #00FF00 is pure green, and #0000FF is pure blue.
 Shorthand Notation: If the values for each color channel are the same for both digits (e.g., #FFCC00), they can be shortened to one digit per channel:
 
 Example: #FFC is the same as #FFCC00.  */

 /* Color Examples:
 Hex Code	Color
 #FFFFFF	White
 #000000	Black
 #FF0000	Red
 #00FF00	Green
 #0000FF	Blue
 #FFFF00	Yellow
 #FFA500	Orange
 #800080	Purple  */

 /* Tips
1.Use a color picker tool to choose colors and get their hex values.
2.Remember, hex codes are case-insensitive: #FF5733 is the same as #ff5733. */
